This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Then, the global-input-app extension dependency is added:

```
npm i @bit/globalinput.web.global-input-connect
```

Finally, the generated ```App.js``` is modified to implement the game logic and the mobile logic for controlling the game. The [src/App.js](https://github.com/global-input/game-control-example/blob/master/src/App.js) contains all the logic.


Lastly run the app in the development mode using 'npm run' or 'yarn' command:<br>
```
npm run start
```

And then scan the QR code displayed with your [Global Input App](https://globalinput.co.uk/) on your mobile.
