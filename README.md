## Mobile Control Example
This is the source code of [a demo application](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/game-example), demonstrating how you can use the [Global Input App library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to achieve [Mobile Control](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-input-control) on a React.js application to allow your users to use their mobile devices to control your application running on other devices. The communication between the mobile and your application is secured using end-to-end encryption. 

### How to Run

   git clone https://github.com/global-input/game-control-example.git
